    <ol>
        <li><b>Prepare the yolk filling: </b>Slice the hard-boiled eggs in half lengthwise, and scoop the yolks out into a small bowl. Mash them thoroughly with a fork, then stir in the Greek yogurt, lemon juice, Dijon, garlic powder, salt and pepper until completely combined. (If you would like a super-smooth filling, you can also blitz the filling in a food processor instead of mashing/stirring everything by hand.)</li>

        <li><b>Fill the egg whites: </b>Using either a spoon or a small cookie scoop or a piping bag (whichever method you prefer), fill the egg whites with the yolk mixture.</li>

        <li><b>Sprinkle and serve: </b>Top each of the deviled eggs with your desired toppings, then serve while they're nice and fresh!</li>
